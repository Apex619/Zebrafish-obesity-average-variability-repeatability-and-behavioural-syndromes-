### MAIN ANALYSIS FOR ALL BEHAVIORAL PARAMETERS BY SEX AND TANK
1) cHECKING NORMALITY ASSUMPTIONS WITH MIXED MODELS AND A HISTOGRAM OF RESIDUALS
2) PERFORMING REPEATABILITY ANALYSIS FOR EACH SEX IN EACH TANK SEPARATELY (USING SUBSETS) AND THEN WITH BOTH DATA COMBINED FOR EACH TANK
3) CALCULATING DIFFERENCES BETWEEN MALE AND FEMALE REPEATABILITIES IN EACH TANK

THESE STEPS ARE REPEATED FOR ALL BEHAVIORAL PARAMETERS, REFER TO THE FIRST BEHAVIORAL PARAMETER FOR COMMENTS AND REFERENCE
