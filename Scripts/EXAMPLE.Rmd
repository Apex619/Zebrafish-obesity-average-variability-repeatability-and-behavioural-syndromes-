### Load packages
```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

#checks for installation and loads packages
pacman::p_load(lmerTest,ggThemeAssist,rptR,lme4,readxl, tidyr, dplyr, magrittr, lubridate, stringr, purrr,
               sjPlot,ggplot2,lubridate,wesanderson,ggbeeswarm,emmeans,patchwork,viridis,nlme,Rmisc,ggpubr,
               stargazer)

# Load custom functions

```


### Import Data
```{r, include=FALSE}
#Master file with all raw data
Anxiety_Joined <- read.csv("./Data/F1_Anxiety_Repeatability_Exp.csv") 

#Subseting data by tank; NOTE: short tanks are usually referred to as "Old" tanks throughout the analysis
Old_Tanks <- subset(Anxiety_Joined, Anxiety_Joined$Tank == "Old") 
Tall_Tanks <- subset(Anxiety_Joined, Anxiety_Joined$Tank == "Tall") 


#Inspecting imported data 
str(Anxiety_Joined)
str(Old_Tanks)
str(Tall_Tanks)
```

### MAIN ANALYSIS FOR ALL BEHAVIORAL PARAMETERS
1) CHECKING NORMALITY ASSUMPTIONS WITH MIXED MODELS AND A HISTOGRAM OF RESIDUALS
2) PERFORMING REPEATABILITY ANALYSIS FOR EACH TANK SEPARATELY (USING SUBSETS) AND THEN WITH BOTH DATA COMBINED AND EXTRACTING WITHIN-AND BETWEEN-INDIVIDUAL VARIANCES AFTER A Z TRANSFORMATION
3) CALCULATING DIFFERENCES BETWEEN REPEATABILITIES
4) FINAL MIXED MODEL USING LME FUNCTION
5) CALCULATING VARIANCE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN TALL AND SHORT TANKS

THESE STEPS ARE REPEATED FOR ALL BEHAVIORAL PARAMETERS, REFER TO THE FIRST BEHAVIORAL PARAMETER FOR COMMENTS AND REFERENCE 

# Total distance travelled
```{r, echo=FALSE}

#Check Normality with mixed model and then histogram of residuals

Model_Tot_Dist <- lmer(tot_dist ~ Tank + Sex + (1 | Fish_ID), data = Anxiety_Joined) #mixed model 
hist(residuals(Model_Tot_Dist)) #histogram of residuals to check for normal distribution (easiest way to check assumption of normality)


#Calculating repeatabilities using custom made functions
rpt_tot_dist(Old_Tanks) -> Old_Tot_Dist #repeatability for short tanks
rpt_tot_dist(Tall_Tanks) -> Tall_Tot_Dist #repeatability for tall tanks
rpt_tot_dist(Anxiety_Joined) -> Joined_Tot_Dist #repeatability overall (both tanks)

#Obtaining within-individual and between-individual variance for total distace 

rpt_within_between_tot_dist(Old_Tanks) -> within_between_tot_dist_old #Short tanks
rpt_within_between_tot_dist(Tall_Tanks)-> within_between_tot_dist_tall #Tall tanks

q1 <- quantiles_diff_boot(Tot_dist_diff) #obtaining 95% CI
